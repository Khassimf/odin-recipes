    <h1>Thiebou Djeun</h1>
    <img src="../recipe-images/TDjeunFinal.jpg">
    <p>
        Thiebou Djeun means “rice with fish.” This simple dish
        is a national delicacy in Senegal, a country located on 
        the west coast of Africa with easy access to everything the
        sea has to offer, including food.
    </p>

    <p>
        While oral tales vary slightly when it comes to conveying
        the inspiration behind this dish, a renowned community cook
        named Penda Mbaye is often credited with making the first 
        documented Thiebou Djeun in the 19th century. Nonetheless,
        one central element binds all the different narratives:
        the love of culinary arts, and passion for sharing.

        According to local storytellers, Mbaye used to work as a 
        cook in one of Saint-Louis' colonial residences. Back then,
        Saint-Louis was the political and cultural capital of 
        Senegal and the principal place of residence of the French 
        colonizers. Mbaye would cater for large ceremonies, official
        events, and elite social gatherings in Saint-Louis. However,
        there came a season where the region experienced a shortage
        of barley, which was the more popular grain in Senegal's 
        kitchens at the time. Mbaye used rice instead, which gave       
        birth to the Thiebou Djeun recipe as we know it today.
        Nowadays, variants of the recipe exists across Senegal,
        where fish is replaced by other elements, including 
        <em>Thiebou Yapp</em> (rice with beef or lamb);
        <em>Thiebou Guinar</em> (rice with chicken), and 
        <em>Thiebou Guerte</em> (rice with peanuts).

    <h3>How to cook the rice</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a mortar and with a pestle or in a food processor grind the scotch bonnet peppers and garlic into a rough paste)
        </li>
        <li>Saute the sliced onions in the oil over medium heat until translucent</li>
        <li>Add in the tomato paste, and stir fry for 5 minutes. The tomato paste may start to brown a little.</li>
        <li>Add in the ground garlic and scotch bonnet and stir fry for another 2 minutes</li>
        <li>Add in bullion, black pepper, and 8 cups of water. At this stage, taste the sauce for salt, and adjust to your preference.</li>
        <li>Add in the tough vegetable first in to the sauce and cook until tender. In this case, add in the sweet potatoes, cook until tender and remove, then the carrots, cook until tender and remove. Continue adding in the vegetables until all the vegetables are cooked.</li>
        <li>Set the cooked vegetables aside and then add in the fish and cook in the sauce for 2-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the fish has simmered in the sauce for 2-5 minutes, gently remove it from the sauce.</li>
        <li>At this point, drain the rice that has been cooking and pour into the sauce. The sauce should just cover the rice. Adjust the amount of water at this stage if needed to make sure that the rice is just covered.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot and simmer on low-medium heat for 15-20 minutes. You may seal the cover of the pot with foil to prevent steam from escaping.</li>
        <li>At the 15 minute mark, check that the rice has absorbed the moisture and is soft. Cover and cook for another 5 minutes if it needs more time. If the water has dried up and the rice is still not soft, add in 4 tbsp of water, cover and allow to cook.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with the vegetables and fish, and lime wedges</li>
